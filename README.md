# Axial Distance Prediction

This repository contains the code for the Master's thesis _Axial Distance Prediction as Pretraining for Lung Nodule Segmentation_. The thesis presents the novel _Axial Distance Prediction_ self-supervised method that makes explicit use of the volumetric nature of medical image data by predicting the distance between pairs of axial slices in CT scans based on their embeddings. The method is used to pretrain a _Swin-Unet_ model for lung nodule segmentation on the _LIDC-IDRI_ data set
